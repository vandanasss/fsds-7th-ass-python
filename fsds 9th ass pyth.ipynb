    "1.To what does a relative path refer ?\n",
    "Ans: The relative path is the path to some file with respect to your current working directory (PWD).\n",
    "For example: if Absolute path to a file called stuff.txt is: C:/users/admin/docs/stuff.txt If my PWD is C:/users/admin/ , then the relative path to stuff.txt would be: docs/stuff.txt\n",
    "Note: PWD + relative path = absolute path\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Where does an absolute path start with your Operating System ?\n",
    "Ans: In Linux based systems the absolute path starts with /. Where as in Windows based systems absolute path starts with C:\n",
    "\n",
    "3.What does the functions os.getcwd() and os.chdir() do ?\n",
    "Ans: os.getcwd() method tells us the location of current working directory (CWD). Whereas os.chdir() method in Python used to change the current working directory to specified path. These functions are similar to linux commands pwd and cd"
